### bgscripts.bashrc

#### WELCOME

bgscripts.bashrc started life in 2013 as my ~/.profile for kornshell 93 on AIX 7.1.
As my main environment switched to GNU bash on Linux, my needs changed.

#### BEHAVIOR
 --fcheck
The script returns its version if you pass it the --fcheck flag. This is a legacy command which originally meant "framework check" to see what version of the framework library was in use.
 --noglobalprofile
Skips loading the /etc/bashrc. Otherwise, reads /etc/bashrc if running on Linux.
 --nodeps
Acts as --noos and --noflavor.
 --noos
Skips the os-specific bashrc in /usr/share/bgscripts/bashrc.d/.
 --noflavor
Skips the flavor-specific bashrc in /usr/share/bgscripts/bashrc.d/.
 --noclear
Skips the clear and tty display commands.

Reads the local profile, so ~/.bashrc.local if it exists.

#### VARIABLES
thisos
thisflavor
thisflavorversion
PATH
PS1
sudo
_lscolorstring
SERVER

VISUAL
EDITOR

#### SIMPLE FUNCTIONS
psg = ps -ef | grep $1
ll = ls -l
vir = vi -R
own = chown $USER:${thisusersprimarygroup}
sshp = ssh with only password auth. Useful for ensuring a documented password is correct, or gssapi auth hangs.

#### COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
newest dir/ filepattern
The newest function returns the most recently modified file that matches pattern "*filepattern*" in the entire directory structure of dir/
Example:
vi $( newest /var/log/application webapp )

ccat
Color cat. Wrapper around the highlight -O ansi command.

htmlize
Modifies standard in to replace every less than < sign with the html &lt; representation of it. Also does greater than > and ampersand & signs.
Example:
cat file1.txt file2.txt | htmlize > files.html

permtitle
Modifies the PROMPT_COMMAND with your string, so the terminal window title is changed permanently.
Caches the original value so calling permtitle without any parameters resets it.
Examples:
permtitle "remoteuser@farawaydevice"; ssh remoteuser@farawaydevice.example.com; permtitle;

### bashrc.d/rhel.bashrc
update-repo allows you to list updates for just one specific respository. Includes bash autocompletion of respository names.
Example:
update-repo smith122rpm

Other bash autocompletions, including for bounce.sh.

### bashrc.d/debian.bashrc
update-repo allows you to download update filelists for just one specific debian source list.
