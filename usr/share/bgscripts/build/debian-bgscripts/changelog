bgscripts (1.1-31) stable;

  * Removed the old /usr/bgscripts location.
  * Added to the sudoers.d file the env_keep proxy settings.
  * Removed the /README.md file from the package.
  * Added the update-desktop-database command to the %postun
  * Fixed "thisuser/thistheme" this nomenclature for loops in scriptlets.
  * Fixed From: field in send.sh.
  * Fixed rdp.sh debug and error messages to be more helpful and specific.
  * Separated bgscripts-core from bgscripts. This was to simplify the scriptlets for cli-only systems that don't need rdp or icons or anything of that sort.
